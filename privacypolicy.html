                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <p><strong>DriftGuard</strong> is designed to be a privacy-focused tool. We do not collect or store any personal data that identifies you directly. All core application data remains entirely local to your device.</p>

                <h3>Locally Stored Data</h3>
                <p>The following information is stored only in your browser's local storage or memory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Uploaded Audio Files</b>: Files uploaded for custom cues are temporarily stored in your browser's memory and are deleted when the session ends or the app is closed. They are never transmitted to our servers.</li>
                    <li><b>Session Preferences</b>: Your selected focus time, break duration, and reminder interval are saved locally to streamline future use.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Third-Party Services (Analytics and Advertising)</h2>
                
                <p>We use third-party services to support and analyze our service, including advertising (for which this policy is being prepared).</p>
                
                <h3>Google AdSense / Analytics</h3>
                <p>If advertisements are displayed, they are served by Google AdSense. Google and its partners may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this or other websites. Please review the Google AdSense Privacy Policy for information on how they handle data collection and tracking.</p>

                <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
                <p>Our application contains links to external sites (like our Feedback form or Contact Us email). We have no control over the content or privacy practices of these sites and assume no responsibility for them.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use your personal information for any purpose beyond serving basic non-personalized advertisements (if applicable) and facilitating the core function of the application (e.g., storing your timer preferences locally).</p>
